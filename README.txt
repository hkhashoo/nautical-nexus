Nautical Nexis - One Page Site
Generated: 2025-11-07T09:09:28.812386 UTC

Important note about fonts:
- The site uses the Roboto webfont via Google Fonts. When you open index.html directly using the file:// protocol,
  some browsers (Chrome, Edge) will block external network requests or treat them differently, which prevents the
  Roboto font from being fetched. This is why you may see the default system font instead.

How to run the site locally (recommended):
1) Open a terminal in the folder containing these files (where index.html is).
2) Run a simple HTTP server so the files are served over http:// instead of file://
   - Python 3:    python -m http.server 8000
   - Node (http-server): npx http-server -p 8000
3) Open your browser and navigate to:
   http://localhost:8000/
4) Fonts and other network resources (Google Fonts) will load correctly when served over HTTP.

If you cannot run a local server and need fonts to work offline, I can embed Roboto font files locally into the project
(licensed for web use) — tell me and I will add self-hosted font files and @font-face declarations so the site works
completely offline without network calls.

Color scheme update:
- Primary: deep navy (#0b3d91)
- Accent: coral (#ff6b6b)
- Support: sea green (#00a896)
These are applied in index.css. If you'd like a lighter or darker variant, tell me which direction and I will tweak it.

If you'd like, I can also:
- Convert to a React+MUI app
- Self-host Roboto fonts to guarantee offline usage
- Deploy a preview to Netlify or GitHub Pages for you
